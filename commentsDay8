There are so many different paths to take in order to complete a mission like the one you gave us today. For every bit of code I write I see new perspectives and new ways of handling messages and general user control, but still; these are the basics.

One question: I tried using the System.err.out within the code, but realized all error messages posted at the end of the output (and not in the logical order).

One comment: I find the following shortcut very useful: Press Ctrl and click a method name lead you to the method code.

BTW: I added you as a collaborator to this git-project, which I hope will give you the ability to comment directly, add files and so on. If you prefer email I will of course use that.
